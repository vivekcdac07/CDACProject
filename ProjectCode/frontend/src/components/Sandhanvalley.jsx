                        Sandhan valley is a water carved valley around 200 feet deep. Sandhan is located near beautiful
                        Bhandardara region near village called Samrad. Samrad village and Sandhan Valley is surrounded 
                        bu Alang,Madanad Kulang mountains. This place also has Ratangad,Ajoba and Kalsubai mountain ranges.
                        Sandhan Valley is a gorge cut by wild water streams gushing down ferociously from nearby mountains 
                        during the monsoons for past thousands of years. The streams fall in to the valley beyond the
                        gorge and form a pond. To reach the pond one has to rappel down from the far end of the gorge in 
                        to the valley.At certain places, the width of the trail is less than 3 feet and other points 
                        lie in the sun shadow area thereby giving the place another name called valley of shadows. At the
                        end of valley, one is met with magnificent views of deep valleys and high cliffs. One patch of 
                        45 feet needs to be rappled down.The other two patches need to be climbed down with the help of 
                        ropes. After climbing down the second rock patch,camp would be set on the flat ground where you 
                        can sleep under twinkling stars away from the hustle and bustle of the city.There is a small 
                        stream flowing into a huge pond. The stream is the source of fresh drinking water as pond water 
                        is not suitable for drinking purpose. There could also be a chance that you get to witness 
                        shooting stars at night from aperture created by 15 feet wide and 200 feet long walls. This 
                        makes Sandhan Valley  trek even more special and memorable.
